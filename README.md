## Data Mining Pipeline
We have executed the Data Mining pipeline in order to define a model that can be used to predict the Chagas disease.

## Conclusion
The train data fit well with Random Forest Classifier, among the given algorithms, with a test acuracy of 0.95 and an F1 Score of 0.92. So we used the same Random Forest model to test on the holdout data. The data was made to go through all the preprocessing stages that we have done on the train data. The model predicted 2705 Negative classes and 112415 Positive classes.
